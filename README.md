### Motivation

To refactor an application in its Native RESTful format to a MERN stack framework. 

### Build

I built this product to allow users to discover books they may have an interest in. 

### Solve

It provides avid book readers, an easy and convenient way to query and discover new books.

### Learn

I learned the differences between these two frameworks. The main difference between a RESTful app and a MERN app is that a RESTful app is focused on building APIs, while a MERN app is focused on building full-stack web applications. RESTful apps are stateless and use HTTP requests to communicate with servers, while MERN apps use MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js to build complex web applications.
